# Crypto Trading Open AI Gym

`CryptoTradingGym` is a collection of [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) 
environments for reinforcement learning-based trading algorithms.  It was 
forked from [`AnyTrading`](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading).

`CryptoTradingGym` is intended to be used with another project I authored, 
namely [`nupic_predictor`](https://gitlab.com/cybertronninja/nupic-rest-interface).
